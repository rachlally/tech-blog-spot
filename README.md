# Tech Blog Spot
A CMS-style blog spot to write about tech

## Description

As a new developer, being able to build confidence in programming can be a slow process.  Writing about tech is just another way to grapple with all the new concepts.  Hopefully by creating this site, I will gain confidence learning and writing about tech in order to grow in my new role as a developer.

I learned more about the uses of handlebars for templating a website.  I learned to apply CRUD functionality to a site.  I became more comfortable with routing backend data and front end functionality.  I learned how to deploy a site to Heroku.    

## Installation

To install, git clone the repo.  Run `npm i` to install all necessary packages. Run `npm run seed` to seed the database.  Run `node server.js` to view and edit on local browser.

## Usage
